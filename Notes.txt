This lab requires some packages to be installed:
The express and nodemon package for starting and running the Express server 
and jsonwebtoken and express-session for session based authentication.

express - This is for creating a server to serve the API endpoints.
nodemon - This will help to restart the server when you make any changes to the code.
jsonwebtoken - This package helps in generating a JSON web token which we will use for authentication. A JSON web token (JWT) is a JSON object used to communicate information securely over the internet (between two parties). It can be used for information exchange and is typically used for authentication systems.
express-session - This package will help us to maintain the authentication for the session.

These packages are defined in as dependencies in packages.json.

run 'rm -rf node_modules' to remove node_modules 
then npm install to install them again if you run into issues stating up the server
BUT NEVER PUSH node_modules!!!
